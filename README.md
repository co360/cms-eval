A history of many CMS - Content Management System I have used and evaluated.

I have used quite a few CMS for blogging purpose in the past. Some I like,
some not so much.


## Hisotry of CMS I used

### http://jroller.com/thebugslayer/

One of my earlier blog (I wrote about Scala programming then).


### http://saltnlight5.blogspot.com

I moved the blogging into google Blogger for easy use and looks compare
to jroller.

### https://lesscodelessbug.wordpress.com/

I tried wordpress, but didn't like it much then move back to Blogger.

I stayed with this for few years. Wrote mostly on Java and related programming
topics.

### https://github.com/zemian/adocblog

Wrote my own CMS (using Java and Asciidoc)

Hosted in Heruko and my own server.

* Too much work to just maintain CMS for personal use!

### https://github.com/zemian/zemian.github.io-site

Use jbake (static site generator) to publish blogs

Result is then publish to zemian.github.io

* Too much work to publish an article!

### https://medium.com/@zemiandeng

It looks good and easy to use, but it has limit of visists on free users!
This really bugs me.


## CMS Evaluation

### Site Generators Evaluation

* Jeykyll (ruby) https://jekyllrb.com/ 
	- QuartzScheudler site is using this
	- It main format is Markdown, and I like asccidoc more.

* Pelican (python) https://blog.getpelican.com/
	- I like python and thought this would be best for me. But at the time I love asciidoc
	  but it's not well supported.

* Hugo (goland) https://gohugo.io/
	- Looks good and has many theme support and it looks good. But I don't know much
	of go programming.

* jbake https://jbake.org/
	- Well java is my bread and butter lang, so I thought I will stick with this. Also
	the asciidoc support is good. So I choose this to make my github pages. 


### VuePress

https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/

Use Markdown and VueJS to power blog or documentation site.

> Note: Great for docs, but for blog, I find Tags not working. And "dev" mode
> doesn't support search?

### Gridsome 

https://gridsome.org

Gridsome makes it easy for developers to build static generated websites & apps that are fast by default ðŸš€

> Note: This framework is much larger compare to VuePress! It also require more setup.
> Seems to much to setup for simple blog publishing.

A ReactJS based app.
